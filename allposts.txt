notes  ok so the intro up until how did this happen, as well as the first few lines of the nothing section are fine. even though you might think the intro would be problematic, if anything would be, but it's really not.  but let's face it, the nothing section is really long, and if we can shorten this section then we may get the entire video off on a briefer foot  but first  sleep  pick up the Wacom   etc  see where that leaves us.  it won't really be necessary to draw anything necessarily,   but we gotta figure out if the existential part works all the way through   and see how bad a chain reaction it imposes on the rest of the video   and overall i wouldn't mind really, if it gets shorter , and stays strong. after all, I don't have the power to make a 22min vid. i just don't.    
notes  loving blender although very dense. then had realization that interface may be garbage the above all reason is the impossibility of exporting things without this insane charade of manually renaming them without prompt and without warning of overwrite. I don't know how you could function like this  also scary is no prompt to save, etc things just overwrite everywhere and all the basic file controls taken for granted on any program are not there. to a dangerous degree. it would be like being forced to count your steps manually on the way to the grocery store   so after reading a couple of reviews i started looking for other progs  wings3d was a dream at first but whoops no anim. now on aoi. found a 2009 version , had to really dig. love that it feels almost as simple as superpaint or something. but really there are prob not enough controls and i fear it really is insanely prim. but hey, if u think about it, it's at least worth checking to see if a globe would work  it is important to remember that shortly before I ran into the export file name overwrite crisis in blender, I had just arrived at a bold decision to basically not fully do territories in blender-- and this was after laboring for hours to get the key out and transparency etx.... then I realized... the glow/cross fade that happens so often with my territories....  so i decided to

I'm gonna make a long video&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't care        News Flash we're gonna make a (sung) Looooong video (spoken) get ready to go (sung) 'Behind the Scenes' (spoken) as we make that long video      second video&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quick bong and colorful 1 screen expanding title ,&nbsp;&nbsp;behind the scenes, making a long video  step 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have to tell vine you're doing a long video and you're gonna give behind the scenes updates on vine every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;i don't care how long this takes i (sung) gotta make a long video    vid 3 (quick blip)behind the scenes update  ok now we have to decide what kind of video we're doing.  are we doing a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;song &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;science (video) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;history (video) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some kind of music lesson &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a longer behind the scenes video about another video &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;autobiographical FIND OUT NEXT, WHEN I FIND OUT!!     previously on 'Making a long video while still making short videos' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i still don't know what kind of video to make, and i want to do them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;(rhythmic rapped pickup to jingle)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so I got to use&nbsp;&nbsp;(sung) Randomization ! super catchy but super chromatically slippery and chordally dense  show going to the site but also wild bright flashing colors  and quickly in the same vid, show the list (below) and the entering of the number and immediately like an alarm sort of thing on the one that is selected       for those of you just joining us:&nbsp;&nbsp;we're making a video longer than 6 and a half seconds   song research music lesson behind the scenes autobiographical            this is a good idea but FACE IT  if u pick song, or, fuck it, whatever u pick  you're not really gonna be able to do behind the scenes on the content of the video,  are you kidding the only way to do a good behind the scenes video is to actually show what's in the video       step      approach it again       so really then   how the F will this ever work    back to trying to just keep doing 7 vines and do the long ones at the same time  i am still assuming it's possible but i have a ways to go    so where does that leave us with tues?&nbsp;&nbsp;and are we still obliterating the schedule     
vid  behind the scenes  desk cam... kind of dazed and confused  how can i make long videos ... if i have to make 7 vines a week?     still can't think of a good setup     gonna make a longer video I don't care if it takes forever   that's srsly the best &nbsp;setup &nbsp;I can think of   srsly &nbsp;there's no where else to go for me without experimenting with longer videos      how to make a video longer than 6 and a half seconds    I still like the idea of somehow &nbsp;announcing it first &nbsp; even though I still can't find the wording

note this song length crisis is fucked.  also a problem with videos. the schedule is good, but god damn there's got to be some rules about length . so hey, that's not too hard to do.  think about it.  length regulations are the thing that is really separating you from the real content creators.   imagine if u had length regulations--- for even Monday!!!  you would be forced to actually write something! with meaning! about a topic!!  I think it is possible to figure this out. if it is possible to figure out how to start posting 5 days a week, it is possible to figure out the length crisis. it's simple, just figure out what you want to do and do it.

 note   hi   church   meeeeeek  hi  it's whatever  I'm whatever    how am I gonna post stuff and what kind  what do you think  I need to go to square one and have a zen moment, right?       ok, just want to post and make crazy content, and get crazy, ok?  getting there   again not sure what I should do  you need to get super clear and free, which I think I will do when I get home   I'm just not sure, but I want things to be clear and simple, and also, i DO want to make new content.  keep posting notes. I think that's real..... super real, what do you think?  and recording songs, for sure , hell yea, hella!  and making music videos too is fine, whatever. what do you think? I think you have to choose them right, what do you think, right?  oh wow.   making music videos is going to be a great excuse to make content, right?       what about text videos???  how you going to get to this?  you really have to do it from notes, don't you.  yes and no. that would surely create a date crisis        fuck sake why can't you make weekly videos  don't worry there will be at least notes on the reg.   and pictures.  come on , you can get this.  what else is laying around in visual queue??  really ought to do the rome/christianity acquisition   really ought to work with project sort.  srsly.   there is mad bad stuff to do.  but if you are dealing with improv sessions, then you're going to need to get a sense of completeness and thus a good starting point.  eek  can't wait to get home but i need to sleep  look at project sort  srsly, I think you got everything you need in there  and if not then put more things in there.   huh? can I get it? wtf, can u always be working?   what about going thru improv archives in a less random manner?  I would appreciate that.    what do u think   jeez I want to get this so bad I could buy a new pony or camel

note  hi  good morning  I'm in space  I just woke up    I anticipate getting home so i can do more work. that's about it, seriously, there's nothing else to this  seriously very excited about posting content.  it's crazy. in the process of posting individual songs. does that make sense.... note taker should go up soon, what do you think. holy crap, this is going to be great, im going to post everything!

note   free falling into the future. the only thing I can do to remedy this is accelerate song recording.
 note   convinced that I'm going to get a daily post schedule going.  can you post 1 movie a day? maybe? maybe. &nbsp; let me think about this. &nbsp;can you move one thing along from each department per day? I dunno. you have to move one thing per day. how bout that. no, still doesn't quite make sense.&nbsp;  what about dropping a finished product? ie scoring something from scoring cue???&nbsp;  getting warmer.  jus looking for a foolproof system here.  what of longer products?  how and when can I choose to work on them, how much, and which ones?? ie how long?   what is the story really???  pictures are whatever, they are easy.  the longer the piece, the more &nbsp;carefully you have to choose it.  so how can we deal with that flexible multidimensionality?  &nbsp;I like the idea of regular releases.  but I haven't yet grasped the flexibity of the diff lengths of content you could choose from.  what's to keep you from slipping into always doing easy pictures?       there's got to be a simple solution to this.   I feel like I'm trying to solve a rainbow       thing is, I wish you could just say to do 1 thing per x amount of time, but the problem is, the size is the projects are too variable.

it's like, if you have a plate of chicken wings, amid a million other dishes, and you demand that the chicken wings get finished, it will never happen. but if you just let anybody eat anything as desired, hey, likely the wings will get finished.
the good news is that the sun continues to rise on a steady basis, regardless of what else happens. &nbsp;it's a very comforting cycle that we all could stand to learn from.

You are your own person, and thus&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free .  and therefore, you can also make use&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;existentially free&nbsp;&nbsp;mediums&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the way that you want to    but the difference is now that you have graduated from insecure school, you have a responsibility to breathe and feel love for sure and certain .&nbsp;&nbsp;do you know what this means yet, i'm not sure you do .   you'll have to walk around and/or stay home until you figure it out . it takes time   it's real,  it's you if you're not used to doing this, i can't see how you would be  YOU ARE FREE  and yes, you know how to use these mediums,&nbsp;&nbsp;but you had not previously had all your eggs in this basket .  you have now recovered all your eggs ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place them in the basket&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ok ,&nbsp;&nbsp;please .   here&nbsp;&nbsp;they&nbsp;&nbsp;go&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[ eggs&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dropping&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;basket&nbsp;&nbsp;]]    The basket&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consists&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that you have time to do ,&nbsp;&nbsp;all creative medium which you have time and scheduling&nbsp;&nbsp;sovereignty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    So there it is .   there is no more&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not having eggs&nbsp;&nbsp;in the basket .   you have actually done pretty fantastically impressive things in these mediums, in a free and creative manner,&nbsp;&nbsp;with basically no eggs .   but now ther's eggs. so egg it.

Okay , then .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looks pondiferous .   so ,&nbsp;&nbsp;to grasp&nbsp;&nbsp;(to escape)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new meaning ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we are collectively&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reqesting //&nbsp;&nbsp;asking&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your permission&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;&nbsp;advice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  on the subject of&nbsp;&nbsp;how&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXACTLY&nbsp;&nbsp;to make up the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agenda&nbsp;&nbsp;list&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   because&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stated&nbsp;&nbsp;and dilligently&nbsp;&nbsp;requested&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that your overall agenda  in the grand scheme of things&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is overwhelmingly fine, and correct .&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this true, and can it be true,  and well, no and yes, cause you can forget .   and as you can see we understand this .&nbsp;&nbsp;(i / you's&nbsp;&nbsp;being switched, etc.)    so&nbsp;&nbsp;try&nbsp;&nbsp;and help&nbsp;&nbsp;us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;started&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be true&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to myself&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ourselves    get truth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(let)s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.............................................................................................  OK .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       so what the hell were we all asking ourselves here ?   DAMMIT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  there is frustration here, and it hits a wall of frustration .&nbsp;&nbsp;that couldn't be good .    fuck it,&nbsp;&nbsp;fax me some new memos .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;___________&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i want to&nbsp;&nbsp;see thru&nbsp;&nbsp;the telescope&nbsp;&nbsp;at something that is near, new, and blinding .   But&nbsp;&nbsp;WHY ?   and do you think you are ready ?   Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think i'm ready .   well,&nbsp;&nbsp;fine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.. come near me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they said    who sai d?   gather round,&nbsp;&nbsp;we all said .   (What are they going to say ?)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we all wondered   nobody's going anywhere, saying anything . she indicated  we're all (self) included in this .    go somewhere&nbsp;&nbsp;you feel comfortable (and/or)&nbsp;&nbsp;familiar .&nbsp;&nbsp;that's the only way&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;get //come&nbsp;&nbsp;control&nbsp;&nbsp;of this .   looks tired / and familiar&nbsp;&nbsp;, i know is what youre thinking . tired and familiar tired and familiar tired and familiar   so,&nbsp;&nbsp;fine , ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go the long way&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??  Well it seems you shouldn't have to ,&nbsp;&nbsp;is what i've always said .   (who or me, now&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc&nbsp;&nbsp;mixups are getting backwards)   Ok, well, everybody's tired here, and i honestly don't know who's asking what . so you'll have to try and be more familiar and speak in sense tones // in line // with what you're familiar with .  i don't really see/ understand the problem&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until youre read y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for something&nbsp;&nbsp;to do it .  because&nbsp;&nbsp;You Have&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;do something you're REady&nbsp;&nbsp;For .   so if you're come crying to me // complaining&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'M NOT READY FOR ANYTHING" then i don't really know what to help you with .   cuz you have to be ready for something .   ok then, that's good .&nbsp;&nbsp;so  i guess then  it should be itterated  you asking "what am i ready for "  well, sure that's reasonable .&nbsp;&nbsp;   i think you're ready to count and play crazy games with time, are you not   that is suggestible    you always get hung up on this relevance //belief&nbsp;&nbsp;to other people . or, no, to rephrase that ,&nbsp;&nbsp;the reverse is true, in fact .  so anyway, i understand very well your concerns, strenghts, anxiousnesses, and anxieties .  so let's all get together and think about this one .   i have faith // no doubts&nbsp;&nbsp;that you all are in this for the right reasons .  no ones doubting that ,&nbsp;&nbsp;the thing is,&nbsp;&nbsp;the one who always has the hardest time remembering this is you .   so if you're stressing about what not or what to do at any particular time, my advice would be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to     Take&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;&nbsp;the sunshine .   take it in , while you can or can't .&nbsp;&nbsp;there still is time .   So,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let me try and understand your concerns a little better .   When you take a walk in the sunshine, and then come back, everything is the same, yes ?&nbsp;&nbsp;and the problem is that everything all still seems so separated .&nbsp;&nbsp;is that it ?   a ha .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touching isnt it , how we can't live apart ?&nbsp;&nbsp;damwell for sure i'll be sarcastic .  we have to be a little more sure that something is controlling each one of us at the same time, and thatwhich is the same thing that controls the sun .  Does that make sense , ?&nbsp;&nbsp;there,&nbsp;&nbsp;i just said it for you .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now is that going to make you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;able&nbsp;&nbsp;to get it ?   .......... hold on, i'm thinking .&nbsp;&nbsp;you're // we're&nbsp;&nbsp;getting this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all said to each other .   now how can we do this ?&nbsp;&nbsp;i mean, here, this is it, we can't&nbsp;&nbsp;you can't&nbsp;&nbsp;it can't be denied ,&nbsp;&nbsp;surely this is it , they all said // tried to say .   so omg what next, is what one of them all started saying .   This&nbsp;&nbsp;time ,&nbsp;&nbsp;we're sure of it ,&nbsp;&nbsp;they all said aloud,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certainly .       Ok,&nbsp;&nbsp;so now,&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm stuck here dealing with YOU .&nbsp;&nbsp;now what is it that YOU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need to know, still ?  damn, boy, you are stuck on this tired thing . man, give me a break.&nbsp;&nbsp;buy a more energetic bracelet&nbsp;&nbsp;or something . put wings on it .  do as your thing (d) .   ok fine, what do you want me to say ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you've said (// done it all before . just fuckin&nbsp;&nbsp;  go back and remember it .   you're wearing the same sneakers as you were then ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fuck it .    are you seriously asking me to remember this for you ?   god dam it ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who kidding .    do you think you're getting scared now to have time    do you think now you're getting scared&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just so you'll have more time    and hiding from the fact that merely just upon youre scaredcity&nbsp;&nbsp;alone&nbsp;&nbsp;that you 'd&nbsp;&nbsp;request for more time, and thus you are not letting yourself get to the bottom of this .  you have all you own darned notebooks in your posession .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have what it means to take care of this , you're just not doing it ,&nbsp;&nbsp;so&nbsp;&nbsp;  don't look at me     your wings&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dried // busted .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   you'll just have to have them&nbsp;&nbsp;re&nbsp;&nbsp;adjusted //wettened&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fixed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;renewed .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Ok,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think i can see what's going on now&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think you might be actually a little scared at how readily available this thing is&nbsp;&nbsp;to all work out ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in these days .  is that is ?   cuz&nbsp;&nbsp;that's it ,&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm pretty sure&nbsp;&nbsp;(i think )   so now , gee willikers ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what are we going to do&nbsp;&nbsp;   ok you're asking me what to do again , and i can't really figure it out, because i am not a person capable of thinking on my own .    ok, let me try and see             you are good .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything looks really good from what i can see , everything looks always and overwhelmingly clear to me .&nbsp;&nbsp; i'm really tired and sick of saying this to me .  it's like there's a million phone booths&nbsp;&nbsp;all standing next to each other, and they all have a perfectly well diligent directory in them .&nbsp;&nbsp;and now you're standing here and you don't know what to do with them.    i think i see the problem .  tell me if i am seeing correctly .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have all the answers layed out for you, in multiple choices .&nbsp;&nbsp;but you feel as though you have to be creative in any choice you make .&nbsp;&nbsp;is that what this is , , ??    ok, yes, that is what it is ,&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm quite certain ,&nbsp;&nbsp;almost&nbsp;&nbsp;thinking .   so what's the solution then, is what you are asking me, or is what your agents are asking me .   and, now, i'm just guessing, brainwashing here ,so dont take this too literally right off the bat, but my one suggestion (and it's just a suggestion, i don't mean to sound serious)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't do anything .  and they will come for you etc it will happen all by itself .  Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;but i'm not sure that's true .&nbsp;&nbsp;don't let me quote you on that, because i really don't fully believe and/or feel that is the case, you know why, because that does not involve you couraging up a solution to anything . so that being lit, i'm in fact sure that answer is no good .  so where were we, anyways, oh ya, i was thinking .&nbsp;&nbsp;  what are some ways you could make fruitful and creative decisions without feeling creative .  right ?&nbsp;&nbsp;is that it ?  no, they all said .&nbsp;&nbsp;yes, and i'm sure, they all notconfusedly&nbsp;&nbsp;acqlaimed&nbsp;&nbsp;at once .  VERY TIREDING&nbsp;&nbsp;this has all been said .   OKAY,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we get it !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was all coming in clearer now,&nbsp;&nbsp;again ,&nbsp;&nbsp;once more .   OKAY  the group said .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;when it actually talks as a whole, everybody listens somehow .     this is ouch madness right here .  i'm telling you,&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm saying, and i'm agreeing with myself here, this is damn ouch march madness .   you are silly  you are silly you are silly you are silly you are silly  there is no more asking and answering, i know longer feel like you are answering to me any more .   so we'll have to wait until another time to do this more thoroughly.     ok, so what are you saying .&nbsp;&nbsp;youre saying&nbsp;&nbsp;that .....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are hopelessly lost and confused ? with regard to what to do ?  because&nbsp;&nbsp;you are willing to do whatever ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so therefore you can't figure out what to do  and you're trying to figure out how to feel "inspired" about something   and you're waiting 10s of thousands of years before you discover all of the correct answers which are in your notebooks ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is that correct?   is that correct ?   am i correc t?   whoa , ok, you just saw it ,&nbsp;&nbsp;a lot of of it ,&nbsp;&nbsp;if i'm correct // ly mistaken ..  hmmm.  so , now, what's going on , are you just afraid to admit it ?  i think yes you are aren't you   Well     YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER EVERYBODY ELSE IN THIS  i think i know that .    he is saying that i am saying this you are saying that   of course, duh   who's talking now    shit                   ok  ok  ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok  what a silly thing this little thing is . it's like we've been trying to get over the mexican bridge .    i want to know whatmore to do on this  tomorrow or today . or any day .  how am i supposed to know&nbsp;&nbsp;what&nbsp;&nbsp;to do&nbsp;&nbsp;when&nbsp;&nbsp;on which day .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i am capable of anything ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he/she was saying .  ok good, we know this, we have established this .  i think you two are meant for each other .  fuck it i dunno who said that, it wasnt us .  dam it.  this is fucked,   this whole thing is fuckin fucked. who are you . this whole damn thing is fucked to pieces, you know that .  i'm nost sure whos talking, and neither should you be .&nbsp;&nbsp;its all non e of its in english . MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY SATURDAY SUNDAY     ok, so the issue now is ,&nbsp;&nbsp;you think you have figured out that the issue is that you have a billion choices but you insist on being creative at every step of theway.&nbsp;&nbsp;and youd surely like to know that you can't apologize for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;you can't seem to find any way out of it&nbsp;&nbsp;, and you probably don't want to.  SO THAT'S JUST IT&nbsp;&nbsp;you insist on feeling creative .   you already wrote the book on being creative . that's the part that should be ironic to you .&nbsp;&nbsp;is you have all your own materials to instruct you how to do this .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but i think you are scared .  yes//no//whatis this .&nbsp;&nbsp;I know .  the question is, when climbing the higher mointain,&nbsp;&nbsp;Who' s&nbsp;&nbsp;the product ?  i see . because when you climb mountains this high, the product is certainly a who, not it .    I get it now,&nbsp;&nbsp;i think , at least .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     so&nbsp;&nbsp;you're wondering again,&nbsp;&nbsp;what you should do , and what your agenda&nbsp;&nbsp;should be .    and i understand and yet don't understand your concerns.    because whatever you did, whatever you plan on doing, you'll need to do it yourself .&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll HAD&nbsp;&nbsp;to've&nbsp;&nbsp;have'd&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;need&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;do it / have done it yourself , because it is YOUR self ,&nbsp;&nbsp;it is YOUR stuff, and it belongs to you .&nbsp;&nbsp;you created it ,&nbsp;&nbsp;you invented it , you needed it .   You'll have to come invent it ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just&nbsp;&nbsp;the way you invented all that other stuff, before .    ALL your old freedom // creativity stuff .&nbsp;&nbsp;you invented it .&nbsp;&nbsp;from the start .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Why&nbsp;&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i dunno , but you did it, somehow .   So it looks // seems as though you would have every right to do the same thing now, am i not mistaken ?   try and think with me on this .   Is that what we're getting at ?   OKAY&nbsp;&nbsp;so now, fuck it , what do you want ?  who the hell are you anyway, and what do you want ?    Start by telling me some basic issues here .  tell yourself that though, not me, cuz fuck it ,who am i, i am just the page talking to yourself.      TELL ME&nbsp;&nbsp;WHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YOU WISH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TO ACHEIVE    well fuck it ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that's a silly comment, cuz we both know all of us know already .   so let's stop holding each other hostage here .&nbsp;&nbsp;but you have to realize that you have seen it , you have to have seen it ,&nbsp;&nbsp;but we just&nbsp;&nbsp;have to go over it again .  you have to go over this again .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you care . right  yes that's what i said .  thank you thank you no thank you thank you  no thank you  no thank you page page  wurztzsz    letters . just sup  ok.  dmn  12 .   ok.  butt.             wtf

PAT, WE'D LIKE TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE
Saturday, April 23, 2011 2:40:56 AM     i am normal
i should really just consider composing all music under the name "sex kitten" .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of course, making this label public would be extremely uncool
 i just got it .       i just got it .         i just got it !    you have to be a man ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by that i mean you have to be a little girl .
i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp;construct work that actually eliminates the rotation of the earth, and then effectively eliminates the rotation of the year .  stuff that transcends the dizziness of these earth cycles .&nbsp;&nbsp;  for example:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let's say you are a spinning skater.&nbsp;&nbsp;it would be like painting a picture of what the room actually looks like, instead of always drawing pictures of the blurred image of it spinning.  this is what i attempt to do for the sun , and for the solar atmosphere in general.  i would like to key into a sense of what the actual absolute dynamic is in this solar system, without constantly having my thinking interrupted by the rapid toggling between night and day.  and the same is true of winter and summer.     i essentially have to teach myself a new language.    because every time i try to get to the heart of these things,&nbsp;&nbsp;it's like an overwhelming surplus of excitement, that can't possibly be expressed, because there is so much buildup of excitement.&nbsp;&nbsp;my communication lines are clogged.  i need to somehow reorganize the information, and reorganize the way i express information, and reorganize the way i organize information .
typically, i just carry on in the ordinary humanoid existence, until one day, when i least expect it, the sun (typically the morning sun)&nbsp;&nbsp;BLOWS MY MIND ..... and i find myself in a bind, swearing up and down to always be loyal to the sun, and that i'll never again forget about it.
Tuesday, April 12, 2011 4:46:35 PM  room is organized .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  how else can i prepare my life so that i can go make a spectacle of myself in public ?
  Thursday, April 7, 2011 2:54:28 PM  &nbsp;i would like to explain a technique &nbsp;called &nbsp;'centering oneself'  just do it. &nbsp;center yourself.
So i Have&nbsp;&nbsp;a Gig,&nbsp;&nbsp;and sure it is at a random time, but windows on houses are in random places and they still let the light in nonetheless.&nbsp;&nbsp;so just, whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;work with the window you've got .
it's 2005 .&nbsp;&nbsp;i don't care who you are.
final cut.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;final&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cut ..... and get crazy with it.
i want to introduce everybody to everyone else .
what if everyone in the country changed their name to larry johnson, on the same day
..... so&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hurry&nbsp;&nbsp;up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;business&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the entire history of business transactions on planet earth .
Riding a train Escaping terrible music on the homefront Dreaming the day away Coping with closed libraries Contemplating going to the movies Not contemplating goingto the movies cause the movies are so bad Thinking about the keys to life and the Pontiac keys to the game shutting up
dude, i have an idea... write a song where the only word you're allowed to say is candy cane.
note to self : &nbspgo own way .
<p>Saturday, February 5, 2011 3:28:30 PM</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>ok, so i have 141 songs left to record.&nbsp; let's say i have approx.&nbsp; 2 days a week to dedicate a full days work. &nbsp; and i need to be done by ... march 18.&nbsp; that's about 6 weeks from now.&nbsp; so that assumes about 12 days from now.&nbsp; i'd have to record 12 songs a day. &nbsp; hmmm.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>doesn't seem possible.&nbsp; if i work&nbsp; 4 full days a week... which is by all means possible.&nbsp; ....&nbsp; i'd have 24 working days until my target.&nbsp; ....</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>so essentially i have to do 2 long songs, 2 short songs, and 1 medium song each day.&nbsp; i don't see why that can't be done.</p>
Instructions  How to get to the 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times 3 and div by 2 4: &nbsp;div by 3 and times 4 3 harmonic: &nbsp;times 5 and div by 4 3 blockade: times 81 and div by 64 2 block: &nbsp;times 9 div by 8 2 harm: 10 div by 9 down to maj7: &nbsp;times 15 div 16 Down to 6 harm: times 5 div 6 Down to 6 block: times 27 div 32 down to b6 harm: times 4 div 5
and while listening to the congos, sure whatever, one thing led to another, and i realized that there is a limerick book on my bookshelf that is burning a hole in my bookshelf.
<p>all the patterns and all the formulas that you are looking for in music and everything has to do with nothing other than our entire soul, in real time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>also, as i was riding the long island train back to the city this morning, electricity occured to me.&nbsp; it occured to me that we are going to learn electricity in real time. ...</p> <p>etc..&nbsp; and all the frequencies that relate to our life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>oh and also, to become a bible salesman.&nbsp; (what?)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
... whats with all these cars and roads?&nbsp;&nbsp;where do they go and come from?&nbsp;&nbsp;what is keeping all of us from welcoming each other into all our own houses?&nbsp;&nbsp;etc.

 Note  Well hi.&nbsp; So here's the situation, really. Early November I started experimenting with videos, text that types itself, and then putting&nbsp;music along to it. On nov 8 I went to see the late show with david letterman, which in reality is not all that late. &nbsp;Then when I returned home, I was inspired to clean up my room and turn it into a television studio.
AHAHAHAHAHA     ahaha  aha ha aha aha    well i am thinking about the days which i used to spew existential craziness.  sometimes it seems there's nothing crazy left to spew, i have to go in and now "produce" some of that craziness.
this is a notebook, it is a white field where i can place letters, and i may or may not place some there right now, at this time.
dear&nbsp;self    it&nbsp;is&nbsp;october    i&nbsp;live&nbsp;on&nbsp;62th&nbsp;street  inside&nbsp;a&nbsp;wall you&nbsp;know&nbsp;that  i&nbsp;have&nbsp;lightening&nbsp;attatched&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;rabies  yes    soup&nbsp;is&nbsp;found&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;kitchen   I eat bread some times, everyday&nbsp;,&nbsp; for sure
I am trying very hard to act like a human. &nbsp; It's interesting. Why can't I do it. Possibly because I've realized something of the greater good in all the universe. &nbsp;Is that part of it? &nbsp;Is that something of it? Ok. So get on the bike. And start riding. &nbsp;Build a bike, and start riding it. So look. &nbsp;What? &nbsp;Look. &nbsp;What???????? Look.  At what?    Look at what you are supposed to look at.&nbsp; Guess Put on a guessing cap. Sing. Wreck some records.   Jeez, sometimes I really don't know which way I'm going.  Have a chance.     Get a chance.       Get a plan.     Get the hell away from here and start doing it.    Speedwalk.  Eat chairs.    Heat up some leftover dinners.       Go absolutely apeshit crazy.    Hide in a duffelbag en route to another country.    Store gremlins in your cheeks.
 Now I am standing in the underground area of some type of underground railroad. &nbsp;The are folks everywhere. &nbsp;When I get above ground I will breathe in a perceptive and relaxed fashion. &nbsp;&nbsp;  actually I didn't. Darn
Note  This is an iPhone.  I am a man with one or two brains.   This is central park.    This is my life.   Wowwwwwwwwie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I. Am.&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ham.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I am. Sam.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ham man.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I.&nbsp;&nbsp;Am.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever you call me I'm getting fed up wight these automatic periods.   Lysol  Is for tastiness    I have ham in my pants       I am a library       I am on earth     I'm afraid I have nothing left to say to my telephone at the moment.
Note So Im going to write songs again.  I feel very good. Breathe the forbidden hymnal fruits of cantankerous degeneration.
Had a dream I looked outside and noticed the moon phase was changing before my eyes, going around about once every 20 seconds.... Then I noticed the pattern on the moon was identical to the continental pattern of earth... The the&nbsp; Moon started tumbling... Then I said I know this is a dream. Then the moon came barreling towards me, and collided with the earth. &nbsp;I woke up, but I was still in a different dream, in approximately the same location.&nbsp;
Hi  I am me  But whatever    So I was working with garage band, and dammit my songs are getting too complex to be processed easily by the GarageBand. &nbsp;I don't know what to do. This track eatbread/feelsure is taking ridiculously long, and it is mainly because it takes like 8 bars to stop the thing after I hit stop, and it most of the time won't even play. I tried exporting the 1sr half of the song and doing it in 2 layers, and I got almost to the end, but still, both halves individually are totally maxed out, and can't handle any more shit. And I can't listen to them anymore without the thing stopping. &nbsp;what really fucked with my brain is that the help page (which of course has been copied verbatim all over the Internet by extremely helpful people) suggests... Among other things... To convert software instruments to real instruments.. i. e. Midi to audio. &nbsp;Now there's a good idea, however... It's actually not possible to do that on garage band. I think it's a poorly written help thing which meant to say they are talking about loops, which I don't use. When using loops it's possible to do that stuff. But that one sentence in the help file made it sound possible to convert midi regions to audio regions. not possible. So now I have to think about how on earth I'm going to get this happening, cause I got to create shit with much more fervor.  How about locking tracks, yes I believe that may be the next step.
I am here, it is time to entertain myself again, all the way up the block.&nbsp;&nbsp;My train is arriving at 4 av.  I am switching to like n or r or something. This room is silent. Garbage juice drips from the ceiling ambiently. Ok so what was that shit?&nbsp;&nbsp;9485. 1897.&nbsp;&nbsp;This contains 7. 271.&nbsp;&nbsp;Done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Official answer is 5, 7, 271.   I don't know if I ever really finished discussing techniques for doing this. I never talked about going from the left. This is often much quicker.&nbsp;&nbsp; Extremely quick.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here comes the train, we'll work with the number of the train. Nevermind, it went by.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ok I'm on the train.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's my number. 5491.&nbsp;&nbsp;3 is out. for 7,&nbsp;&nbsp;I see 91. But 54 is not, so 7 is out.&nbsp;&nbsp;checking 11, I will go from the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;548, plus 22 is 570. 11 out.&nbsp;&nbsp;13 again ruled out based on 91.&nbsp;&nbsp;17.&nbsp;&nbsp;To work from the left, we look at the 54, and then compare it to the next lowest multiple of 17, which is 51.&nbsp;&nbsp;We replace it with the difference. We repace 54 with 3, to get 391. We can go from either side. From the right, we could subtract 51 to get 34 (bingo) or from the left we could subtract 340 and get 51.&nbsp;&nbsp;So now we have to retrace our steps. We know we have found 17 in the original number, but times what?&nbsp;&nbsp;When retracing my steps, I like to redo the calculation from the right side. 5491 minus 51 is 544. Minus 34 is 510. So 510 is 17 times 30, plus the 34 meAns an extra 2. So 32 means 320, plus the extra 3 for the 51.&nbsp;&nbsp;323.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also happen to know that 323 is something.... What was it... Ah yes, 17.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just found that by Adding 17 to it and getting 340. So one less than 20 is 19. So 17 x 17 x 19&nbsp;&nbsp;= 5491.&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a tasty one.
I just typed something of a lesson on number factorization . It was wonderful. It makes me want to eat pumpkin pie all the time.  I think I'll wake up in Brooklyn tomorrow.
So&nbsp;I&nbsp;was&nbsp;going&nbsp;to&nbsp;talk&nbsp;about&nbsp;how&nbsp;to&nbsp;factor&nbsp;numbers.

Life is a funny strange and interesting thing. &nbsp;  I am sitting here enjoying myself on my iPhone as usual, in fact I am at my friend jon's house, texting with fervor on my iPhone. &nbsp; Tomorrow I will rent a cow from the marketplace.&nbsp;  Hahaha &nbsp;dont have a cow. I am a cow.   There is no telling what may happen once things start happening.&nbsp;
I'm sitting inside a bar in northern park slope Brooklyn. It is somewhat of a tea bar. There is music playing, blahblah blah,  I am sitting on a very nice and comfortable couch, seemingly free of charge. I have my iPhone out and I'm texting. I'm here with my friend jon V, he's outside communicating with his girlfriend. There's a sort of Erika Badu sounding song playing. It is Saturday night, roughly. &nbsp;I'm taming my gremlin. I'm breathing..... There's a lot of good stuff to breathe about. I think I'm about to go apeshit with the text.&nbsp; HahahahahahahHHHHHahahahahahahaha I own a small island. I have a house, and in that house there are lots of servants.  Anyway, I'm talking about etheral things, but I should stop.   Brooklyn exists, and I am in it.  They say I'll have to pay the rent sometime soon.&nbsp;  I'm not sure what that means for me and my family.&nbsp;   They say I should rent a studio and start using it.  They say I should hire a band and start playing with it.&nbsp;  They say I should collect a paycheck.  They say I should hire a clown and start being him.  Thy say I should collect insurance on my fallbacks and drawbacks.  They say I should buy a hyper pipe and wear it. They say I should ride in a hyper balloon kite every day. They say I am not man or mammal enough  I'm beginning to become uncomfortable sitting in this unusual location.&nbsp;  Jon's still on the phone with his girlfriend. Whatever. I still don't have an understanding of exactly why I am in here. &nbsp; I find it quite remarkable that I am able to generate words one after another out of nowhere, and keep constantly putting them on the piece of paper on front of me.  Aahh, it feels like I have a library card that's gonna keep expiring for the next 10 years.&nbsp; it's like I am a record keeper, but I've come across an Indian giver.&nbsp; it's like my mammy is dressed in marmalade.  It's like I have nowhere of getting then to here.  It's like I have no yen to get. Only to give.&nbsp;   It's like I have no ferry ride left to pay.  It's as if there is no more then and there, and if and only are the same thing.   It's like I am a wandering watering can.            i haven't chosen a universe.. To fit into. It's interesting, I'm thinking of this as we're listening to 'the love below' record that Andre 3000 put out in 2003.&nbsp;  This is a fantastic record, they're letting it play. It seems to be shuffling both sides. &nbsp;   So, in conclusion, bunny rabbits have both heads and tails, and also I'm excited about the coming elections in 2012, as well as the coming winter olympics in 2012, and also the coming end of the world in 2011.
I just have to quit thinking that im going to do ANYTHING 'normal' or anything that would fit right in to today's reality.
Typing is a very fun and enjoyable thing to do and I really like to do it very very much. Look at me I'm a zebra.

I feel like i'm a centipede with no insurance
6 dimensions can always look like 7, &nbspat least one time in its life
<p>Every day the sun is different.&nbsp; Every day feels like a new, completely different world.&nbsp; I'm not making this up</p>
i've always known that what i'm trying to do is impossible  that's what keeps me from admitting i'm learning to do it
  &nbsp;The train is too long for prose.&nbsp; I'll have to get not bored and not write some.
And it's like, am i trying to remember or forget my ego? And it's like ... Simultaneously forgetting and remembering your ego is the secret to life, so as soon as you notice yourself doing it correctly, your ego will begin to grow out of control. &nbsp;&nbsp;Living in a world of paradox, maybe you begin to realize why jokes, tricks, and games are often saviours and guardians of the truth.

Man, this is going to be a long train ride with no iPod to listen to.&nbsp; Sometimes when the train ride is long, i like to pull out my phone and write poems on it.&nbsp; This time is no different.&nbsp; Will you runaway and get married with me i'm being sarcastic
 i am 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 i am shit where's my phone oh yeah it's in my hand that's why my right pocket's empty whew wait FUCK where's my keys?????    oh wait...............  they are in the ignition, that's why i'm driving... wait...       dude where's my car       cuz i'm flying. 
 Open a cabinet.&nbsp; After you discover it's already open, you can put things in it.  Look at your watch or time piece.&nbsp; Once you figure out what it says, you may begin to tell time.  Hire a baby to sell tires for you.&nbsp; Then you will realize that you are part of both a michelin commercial and a zen diagram. &nbsp;A zen diagram, by the way, is a poem about babies and tires that doesn't make any sense, and is designed to get you hooked on nonsense.&nbsp; It worked for michelin, they sell lots of tires, and it also worked for zen books, they sell lots of nonsense.
I am a bobblehead garbage pale.&nbsp; I represent the coach of the brooklyn garbageball team.&nbsp; I resent being fired, and i resent my team losing the big game to the westland eastsiders.&nbsp; I resent my mother, i resent my family, i resent my name, but most of all, i resent the westland eastsiders.
Phelix the cat had no ancestors.  That would make him an only generation.
the ONLY way to get to know an audience is to walk on stage with no material. PERIOD.
We're a long way from _.&nbsp; You better get over your fears.&nbsp; You're the only one in them anyway.&nbsp; Quit smoking balloons, and it should be just fine.&nbsp; But to get over your fears, you have to experience them, so that would have to involve smoking balloons.&nbsp; Just to let you know, your thing is real, and YES, it is you you are standing face to face with when you stand face to face with another.
Sequenced music is hard to come by. Radio friendly DJs are often plagued by frequent requests for hot remixes, while their generation is suffering irreparable casualties.  Similar to when the right brothers drew up a plane with no wings and still attemptedly insisted on flying.

train prose.   &nbsp;I'm on a train heading to millburn new jersey.&nbsp; I've brought some notebooks with me in order to write down some ideas if i have them.&nbsp; I AM A GIANT SODA. &nbsp;I sort of resemble niagra falls, except I am carbonated and carry a heavy flow of high fruuctose corn syrup.  &nbsp;Remember me?

 starbucks prose There is a coffee bar.&nbsp; I am a coffee pot, next to it.&nbsp; More is less when you work for starbucks.
 bed prose.  I have a thermus. It's name is thermus jervais. It's been there for a long time and it will never go away,. Sometimes when i go for lunch at night i take it, just to have it by my side. Someday soon i will get back to the places where you are. Oh thervais jervais, how i long to have you as my coffeemate.
 "<i><u>damn, i'm in a jam</i></u>"  i have a hand full of jam  i have a house full of ham  i have a mouth full of ham and jam ,   now i am quite in a jam
 bed prose.  I have a window.&nbsp; And beside it sits a lamp.... And next to these items is a library and warehouse you can call your friend.
apples are bigger than oranges, but oranges are faster.
train diary.  I am riding the train home. Damn it takes a long time for this train to get home.&nbsp; I have so much time on my hands i have decided to write prose. Prose by the way is when you write something on paper and it either makes sense or doesn't make sense.&nbsp; It's great, it's like driving a car and then realizing that you ended up in a different place from when you started, and that's how you know the car works.  
Train prose.  I'm at 59th street. &nbsp;This is a manhattan based Q train. &nbsp;This is a queens based operating system. &nbsp;I am a cube based heat machine devouring a liquid blanket. &nbsp;By the way did you know a cube is a vine, check your blackberry. &nbsp;It's truue. &nbsp;YOU ARE IMPORTANT.j
 about songwriting   Doing this is like growing a baby out of steel.  It will whine and complain at you every step of the way for you to make the wildest twists and turns, even unexpected things, like perform voodoo and catch the thing on fire.  Knowing that, true, if you were to just make it some arms and legs into the shape of a baby, it wouldn't be worth anything but a lousy chunk of steel, and wouldn't breathe an ounce worth of life.  The baby knows what you are not to do, only time will tell by it correcting your mistakes if you are able to learn the honed craft of making a baby.
let's see .  i think the most important thing to realize was that holy cow this energy is plenergy .&nbsp;&nbsp;(huh)?
First, i got off the bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;the sky was clear and beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i walked over the bridge   it was sunny and clear and smart.  and by smart i mean the air was clear, and everybody had tons of time on their watch, so they had time to think .. and Think . .. . and&nbsp;&nbsp;THINK .   let's see.. what else. .. . . damn, we did a lot of things .     but overwhelmingly it was sunny and we had a sunny good time .  i speak in the royal we because i am part of the royal family of britain.

write a song a day keeps the apple away
in a chorus, it doesnt matter what notes you sing, what words you say,&nbsp;&nbsp;or which notes mean the most...but it does matter that the meaning gets meant.. <i>somewhere</i> in the notes . ... like,  it doesn't matter where you put the meaning, but it has to go somewhere.

Rule 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do Not &nbsp;Buy&nbsp;&nbsp;your Stoner &nbsp;Blanket       there is no such things as a stoner blanket.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your audience will get mad if you purchase a stoner blanket.

There is an&nbsp; o meter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the o meter that tells you how quickly you got back to the center            etc &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it rates your performance.

Thursday, August 11, 2005 4:34:52 PM    here's my problem: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;every song you ever write has to break rules. &nbsp; &nbsp;    every song ever that was good ever &nbsp; &nbsp; was good because it didnt break rules that other songs did. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;etc            etc.      my other problem is    i want to be free      i want to feel the cool air and dank ambience of being able to roam and go anywhere on the planet i wish .                  adsdfghjfdsafgh 
 ---------------------------------------------------------        there's always a thing, what, cause there is no thing, &nbsp;what,  especially when there is a thing, cause it felt like like there is no thing,&nbsp; and that is enough to have unfortunately made it a thing            etc        so and you see there *is* always a thing,&nbsp; cause it's always *the thing*&nbsp;&nbsp; or lack of      which is the only secondary thing worthy of 'thing'         [i.e., &nbsp;attention to lack of thing]         as it is the only thing other than 'thing' worthy of same 'thing' gratitude       ETC ETC ETC blah blah, &nbsp;the world is lowly
